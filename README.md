# Multiple Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression** using Python.  
It includes **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization** of results.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Implemented Multiple Linear Regression from scratch and using `scikit-learn`.
- Used a sample dataset for training and testing.
- Performed data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling if needed).
- Evaluated the model using **R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
- Visualized predictions vs actual values.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ishanegi5/multiple-linear-regression-project.git
Navigate to the folder:


cd multiple-linear-regression-project
Open the notebook:


jupyter notebook multiple_linear_regression.ipynb
Run all cells to train and evaluate the model.

📊 Results
Model trained on dataset with multiple features.

Achieved good accuracy with R² score.

Visualized the difference between actual and predicted values.

✨ Future Improvements
Add feature scaling (StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler).

Try polynomial regression for better fitting.

Add cross-validation for robust evaluation.
